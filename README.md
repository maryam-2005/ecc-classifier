# ECC Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on classifying error-correcting codes (ECC) using supervised machine learning techniques. Various models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, AdaBoost, SVM, and XGBoost were explored to identify the most accurate and efficient classification method.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

       git clone https://github.com/maryam-2005/ecc-classifier.git
       cd ecc-classifier

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

       pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the notebook:**

       There are three main Jupyter Notebooks:

    - **Dataset Generation (`DatasetGenerate.ipynb`)**: This notebook creates a synthetic dataset for training and testing the models.
    - **Model Training and Evaluation (`RF_DT_adaboost_xgboost.ipynb`)**: This notebook trains the machine learning models of Random Forest, Decision Tree, Adaboost and XGBoost on the generated dataset and evaluates their performance.
    - **Model Training and Evaluation (`SVM.ipynb`)**: TThis notebook trains the machine learning model SVM on the generated dataset and evaluates performance.

    You can open and run the notebooks in order to generate the dataset and train/evaluate the models.
